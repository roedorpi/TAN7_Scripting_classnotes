Tuples
an immutable list is called a tuple

they are very simple, they behave exactly like lists, except:

you use ( and ) instead of [ and ]
you still use the T[n] and T[a:b] notation to refer to parts
they are immutable, so the T[n] and T[a:b] only works at the right hand side
tuple with one element must include a trailing comma: T = (3,)
